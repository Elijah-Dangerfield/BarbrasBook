## Architecture
The architecture used in the app follows model-view-viewModel(MVVM) with a repostiory layer using Retrofit for networking. I used Jetpack's
navigation component to keep the app simple and lightweight with fragments. 

## Folders

### model/
This folder contains the data classes used to model the article data used

### networking/
This folder contains all the sweet sauce for Retrofit 

### util/
This holder contains a helper class that lets me resize text views as well as come Kotlin extension functions to make my life easier

### ui/
Contains all views(fragments) paired with view models

## Things of note
The main recycler view contains a swipe down to refresh feature  <br />
You wont regret sending Barbra a heart in the article fragment

# THANKS :)
