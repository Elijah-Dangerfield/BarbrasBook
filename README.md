# BarbrasBook

## Welcome!

I hope you enjoy my fan app of the one and only Barbra Streisand (a VeRy ObViOuS cElBbRity ChOiCe). 

## Architecture
The architecture used in the app follows model-view-viewModel(MVVM) with a repostiory layer using Retrofit for networking. I used Jetpack's
navigation component to keep the app simple and lightweight with fragments. 

## Folders

### model
This folder contains the data classes used to model the article data used

### networking
This folder contains all the sweet sauce for Retrofit 

### util
This holder contains a helper class that lets me resize text views as well as come Kotlin extension functions to make my life easier

### view
Contains all views (fragments)

### viewModel
Contains the view model used to hold live data to be displayed on screen. 

## Things of note
The main recycler view contains a swipe down to refresh feature  <br />
You wont regret sending Barbra a heart of the article fragment

# THANKS :)
